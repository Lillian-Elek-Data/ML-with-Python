    "## Define the Problem\n",
    "Can the number of books read be predicted based on weekly reading hours?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview:\n",
    "This dataset aims to predict the number of books read per month based on the number of hours spent reading each week. It provides a practical dataset for linear regression tasks, where you can explore how reading habits impact the number of books completed. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trushildhokiya/number-of-books-read-simple-linear-regression\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Features:\n",
    "HoursSpentReading (Feature): The number of hours spent reading per week, ranging from 0 to 20 hours. This feature captures the amount of time an individual dedicates to reading each week.\n",
    "BooksRead (Target): The number of books read per month, with values ranging from 0 to 10 books. This target variable represents the outcome influenced by the amount of weekly reading time.\n",
