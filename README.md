# ML-with-Python
Practice notebooks covering a variety of machine learning techniques
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Standardization
- Training and Testing
- Dummy Variables
- Cluster Analysis
- Logistic Regression

# Simple Linear Regression
This folder contains a the file [Simple Linear Regression](/Simple%20Linear%20Regression/Number%20of%20Books%20Read%20-%20SLR.ipynb) which goes over Simple Linear Regression on a fabricated data csv
- This dataset aims to predict the number of books read per month based on the number of hours spent reading each week. 

# Weather ML
There is a Weather Data csv & Weather Data Regrouped csv inside the Weather ML folder which is used for analysis on: 
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Standardization
- Balancing
- Training and Testing
- Clustering manually and with WCSS
## Weather Data OLS Regression 
The file [Weather Data OLS Regression](/Weather%20ML/Weather%20Data%20OLS%20Regression.ipynb) goes over:
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Standardization
- Training and Testing
## Weather Data Clustering
The file [Weather Data Predictions - Clustering](/Weather%20ML/Weather%20Data%20Predictions%20-%20Clustering.ipynb) goes over:
- Manual K-means clustering with scikit-learn
- Selecting the Number of Clusters with WCSS
- Plotting the Elbow with Standardized Variables
- Analyzing the results
## Weather Data Regrouped Clustering
This file [Weather Data Regrouped - Clustering](/Weather%20ML/Weather%20Data%20Regrouped%20-%20Clustering.ipynb) has a new column Weather_Regrouped: a manula grouping/ simplifying of the original weather column and goes over:
- Balancing the dataset
- Standardization
- Manual K-means clustering with scikit-learn
- Selecting the Number of Clusters with WCSS
- Plotting the Elbow with Standardized Variables
- Silhouette Scores
- Analyzing the results
