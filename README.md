- Standardization
- Training and Testing
## Weather Data Clustering
The file [Weather Data Predictions-Clustering](/Weather%20ML/Weather%20Data%20Predictions%20-%20Clustering.ipynb) goes over:
- Manual K-means clustering with sklearn
- Selecting the Number of Clusters with WCSS
- Plotting the Elbow with Standardized Variables
