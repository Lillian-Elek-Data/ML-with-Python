# Weather ML
There is a Weather Data csv inside the Weather ML folder which is used for analysis on: 
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Standardization
- Training and Testing
## Weather Data OLS Regression 
The file [Weather Data OLS Regression](/Weather%20ML/Weather%20Data%20OLS%20Regression.ipynb) goes over:
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Standardization
- Training and Testing
## Weather Data Clustering
The file [Weather Data Predictions-Clustering](/Weather%20ML/Weather%20Data%20Predictions%20-%20Clustering.ipynb) goes over:
- Manual K-means clustering with sklearn
- Selecting the Number of Clusters with WCSS
- Plotting the Elbow with Standardized Variables
- Analyzing the results
This file goes over the same as above plus balancing
- This data has a new column with Weather 2: a grouping/ simplifying of the original weather column
