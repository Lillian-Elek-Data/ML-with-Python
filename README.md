# Simple Linear Regression - Folder 
The file [Number of Books Read - Simple Linear Regression](/Simple%20Linear%20Regression/Number%20of%20Books%20Read%20-%20SLR.ipynb) goes over the steps to conduct a SLR analysis on a fabricated csv file.

Using a 300-row dataset of BooksRead (target) and HoursSpentReading per week (feature), I fit a simple linear regression and walked through standard diagnostics. The OLS fit shows a very strong relationship (R² = 0.966; F = 8559; p < 1e-200). The estimated slope is ≈ 0.25—each additional hour of weekly reading is associated with about a quarter of a book more per month—with an intercept of ≈ 0.24. Assumption checks looked good overall: histograms suggested approximate normality, the scatter hinted at linearity/homoscedasticity, and Durbin–Watson ≈ 1.87 (near 2) indicated minimal autocorrelation. With an 80/20 train–test split (60 test rows), predictions tracked the held-out targets closely (mean absolute percentage difference ≈ 7.4%, sd ≈ 8.7%), with the largest errors occurring at very low book counts. Taken together, this single-predictor baseline is highly explanatory and interpretable; natural next steps would be to incorporate features like pages/day, session length, or book length and compare against regularized models.
